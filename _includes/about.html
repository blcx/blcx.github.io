              <h2>About Blockchain Coin BLCX Project</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>Blockchain Coin is free to use public blockchain for everyone not just the hardcore wizard developers. It is user friendly (if you know what you are doing) to issue tokens, send message, use the marketplace to sell/buy services. <br> We all face with the problem of the wealthy getting wealthier and if you found a project you like chances are you are already late to join the game because the coin price is already in the moon. <br>BLCX will always reserve coins for airdrop for even latecomers who like to take part with the community. <br>We reserve most of the coins for bounties. 
                <p>Are you a developer? You can check out the source at <a href="https://github.com/blcxx/blcx">Github Source</a></p>
